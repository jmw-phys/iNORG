Version: v1.3.06.p3 @ 2024.04.23
    realized: Finish the first version (v1) of find_combined_number_subspaces_no_active_orbital() function.
    next do : Upgrade this version of the code by 2 stage of free base code.
    thinking: How to relization this function?

Version: v1.4.00.p3 @ 2024.05.03
    realized: Finish the Second version (v2) of find_combined_number_subspaces_no_active_orbital() function.
    next do : Can I use the parallel process in this function to speed up?
    thinking: How to relization this parallel function?

Version: v1.4.01.p3 @ 2024.05.10
    realized: Finish the third version (v3) of find_combined_number_subspaces_no_active_orbital() function, now is specialize for the phss_v2, NOW finding the dim is fast!
    next do : Try to optimize the data structure to save memory.
    thinking: can I use one number to save the hole MatInt in div?

Version: v1.4.02.p3 @ 2024.05.15
    realized: Changed the type to take up less memory when storing.
    next do : Test program stability
    thinking: (same as prev)

Version: v1.4.03.p3 @ 2024.05.16
    realized: Delete exhausted data structures (eg. used TAB and H) to save memory.
    next do : (same as prev)
    thinking: (same as prev)

Version: v1.4.04.p3 @ 2024.05.17
    realized: Kill the updata on v1.4.01 --> v1.4.02
    next do : try the IO table technique.
    thinking: (same as prev)

Version: v1.5.00.p3 @ 2024.05.17
    realized: Try to begin a new data structure, Tabular!
    next do : "Hold_for_a_moment", I will try to fix the fitting function.
    thinking: What kind of data structure do I need to add?

Version: v1.6.00.p3 @ 2024.06.07
    realized: Add the NEW fitting function, and readly for the matrix fitting.
    next do : test for the fitting.
    thinking: this fitting is stable?

Version: v1.6.10.p3 @ 2024.06.14
    realized: Add some modify, add the log for DMFT+NROG iteration, in eDMFTapi
    next do : (same as prev)
    thinking: (same as prev)

Version: v1.7.10.p3 @ 2024.10.05
    realized: 1. Change the V2 to only find_fullH_offdiagonal_idx(); 2. Find the bug for the imprity.cpp; 3. update to fit the "or_deg_idx" situation.
    next do : (same as prev)
